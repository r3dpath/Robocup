/*
This example shows how to set up and read multiple VL53L1X sensors connected to
the same I2C bus. Each sensor needs to have its XSHUT pin connected to a
different Arduino pin, and you should change sensorCount and the xshutPins array
below to match your setup.

For more information, see ST's application note AN4846 ("Using multiple VL53L0X
in a single design"). The principles described there apply to the VL53L1X as
well.
